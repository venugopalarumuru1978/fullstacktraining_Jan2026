State and Props

Here state and props both are predefined objects of the react. 

State :- 

The state is an updated structure that is used to contain and can modify data or information about the component over time.

The state change may occur as a user activity or device event response. 
It decides the actions of the component and how it is to be done by the core of the React component. 

useState() hook can be used to implement state concept. 
---
Props :- 
“Props” is a special React keyword for proprietary purposes, used for data transmission from component to component. 

Props are read-only.

Steps :-  

Create two components like parent and child. here data has to be transfered from parent to child. 

1. Create a parent component, within that componnent call the child component with arguments as follows. 
	<Child Component Name variable=value variable=value .... />
2. Create a child component, while creating use "props" object as a  formal argument component function/method

function ChildComp(props)
{

}
3. Now get values from props objecet as follows in child component
	props.variable  => will get value
--------------------------
Forms

...  :-  Spread Operator :-  it is used to concatenate two or more than two object values into single unit.

let APcities = ["Amaravathi", "Vizag", "Nellore"]
let TSCities = ["Hyderabad", "Warangal", "KarimNagar"]

let cities = [...APCities, ...TSCities];

Routing :- 

Navigating b/w components

Steps:- 

1.  Install following package to work with routing?
		npm install react-router-dom
			you will get following classes
				Link, BrowserRouter, Routes, Route
2.  Create a functional component for NavBar then define all the links as follows
		"Link" class is meant for providing hyper link
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

export default function Navbar()
{
    return(
        <div>
            <ul>
                <Link to="/"><li>Home</li></Link>
                <Link to="/login"><li>Login</li></Link>
                <Link to="/register"><li>Register</li></Link>
                <Link to="/contact"><li>Contact</li></Link> 
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
}
3.  Goto App.js File then define navigators as follows

	import { BrowserRouter, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
	import { Routes } from 'react-router';

	function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <BrowserRouter>
      <Navbar />
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" exact Component={Home} />
        <Route path="/login" exact Component={Login} />
        <Route path="/register" exact Component={Register} />
        <Route path="/contact" exact Component={Contact} />
      </Routes>
      </BrowserRouter>
    </div>
  );
