User Defined Functions :- 
		the functions created by the user as per the requirement is called udf. 

		purpose :-  To divide big task into small no of tasks to avoid complexity.


To create a function,  

1.  Function definition
2.  Function calling


Function definition :-  creating new function with specific task. 

		function  <fun_name([arg])
		{
			.............
			body of the function
			.............

			[return <expression>]
		}

Function calling :-  Execution process of the function.

			<fun_name>([arg values]);

A function can be defined into 4 ways

1.   Without arguments and without return value
2.   With arguments and without return value
3.   With arguments and with return value
4.   Without arguments and with return value

Aruguments / parameters are the values sending to the function while calling. A function can take any no of arguments. 

return value is a value which return after completion of task. It can return only one value.
