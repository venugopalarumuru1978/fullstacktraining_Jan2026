CSS :-  Cascading Style Sheets

it is meant for beautify the web page. 

css can be applied on web page in 3 ways
		
1.  Inline CSS 		:- here css can be applied for tag separately. 
					<tag   style="propname:value;propname:value;...." />
2.  Page Level CSS :-   here css can be defined in the form of classes. 
				these css can placed in <style> tag which is a nested tag of <head>.
			
	these can be written in 3 ways.
		1. defining css for tags directly, those css applies to the tags directly. 
				tagname{
					propname:value;propname:value;
				}
		2. define css classes with .operator as follows
				.css_classname{
					propname:value;....
				}
			once it is defined, it has to be attached to the tag, as follows
				<tag  class="css_classname"  ... />

		3. define css classes with # operator as follows
				#css_classname{
					propname:value;....
				}
			once it is defined, it has to be attached to the tag, as follows
				<tag  id="css_classname"  ... />
3.  Site Level CSS :-  here all css can be defined into separate css file and that can be imported into html file.

			A. Create a new file and save with .css extension
			B. Define all css classes as per the requirement
			C. Link css file as follows in html page(<head>)
			<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' media='screen' href='css file name'>
