State and Props

Here state and props both are predefined objects of the react.

State :- 

The state is an updated structure that is used to contain and can modify data or information about the component over time.

The state change may occur as a user activity or device event response. 
It decides the actions of the component and how it is to be done by the core of the React component. 

useState() hook can be used to implement state concept.

Props :- 
“Props” is a special React keyword for proprietary purposes, used for data transmission from component to component. 

Props are read-only.

	<Child Component Name variable=value variable=value .... />
2. Create a child component, while creating use "props" object as a  formal argument component function/method

function ChildComp(props)
{

}
