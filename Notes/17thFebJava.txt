OOPS
---------------
Once class is defined, Object Creation of the class has to done within the class when that class having
main() method. 

or 

Create another class with main() method, within that class create an object then call method.

Access Specifiers :- 
--------------------
private 	:-  it allows to access class members(variables & methods) within the class only. 
public		:-  it allows to access class members inside and outside the class.
protected	:-  it allows to access one class members into another class.

Note :-  by default every class member is public. 
---------------------
Class members are classified into two types

1.  Non-Static :-  these members are binded with class object. 
			
2.  Static	:-  these members are binded with class. 

	A.  if class having all the static members(variables and methods), no need create object, just call methods
		with class name only.
	B.  static method can handle only static variables whereas non-static method can handle both static and non-		static data.
----------------------
Constructor :- it is a special method of the class which has same name of the class. 

		purpose :-  to specify initial task of the object. i.e. to initialize instance variables at the time 		of object creation. 
A.  It will call automatically whenever object is created. 
B.  It can take parameters, for those parameters values has to pass at the time of object creation. 
C.  A class can have multiple constructors, Each constructor should have different no of parameters.
