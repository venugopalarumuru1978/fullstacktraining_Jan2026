Today's Agenda
--------------
JS Operators :- 
--------------
Arithematic Operators
		+, -, /, *, %
Relational Operators
		>, < >=,<=, !=, ==, ===

		==  :-  it is equal operator where it check weather two values are same or not. 
		=== :-  it is also equals operator where it checks value and it's data both must be same. 
Logical Operators
		&& - AND
		|| - OR
		!  - NOT
Unary Operators
		++  - increment by 1
		--  - decrement by 1
Assignment Operators
		=
		+=, -=, /=, *=, %=

Conditional Operators 
		? :
		<condition> ? <true> : <false>
---------------------------------------------
Control Statements :- 

if statement :- it is used to check conditions, based on condition true / false some statements will be executed. 
	Simple IF
		if(condition)
		{
			set of stmts
		}

if - else 
		if(condition)
		{
			set of stmts
		}
		else
		{
			set of stmts
		}

else - if
		if(cond-1)
		{
			set of stmts
		}
		else if(cond-2)
		{
			set of stmts
		}
		..............
		..............
		else if(cond-n)
		{
			set of stmts
		}
------------------------
Loops :-  the process of repeating task for n number of times. 

variable initilization
looping condition
looping task
looping termination stmts

while loop

		variable initilization
		while(condition)
		{
			set of stmts
			increment / decrement operations
		}

print ur name 10 times

	let x = 1;
	while(x<=10)
	{
		console.log("Venugopal");
		x++;
	}
for loop
		for(initilization;condition;iteration)
		{
			set of stmts
		}
---------------------
User Defined Functions:- the function created and managed by user is called user defined function. 

function definition:- 
-----------------------
function <fun_name>([arg])
{
	body of the function
}

function calling:- 	fun_name([arg values]);

A function can be defined into 4 ways

1.  without arguments and without return value
2.  with arguments and without return value
3.  with arguments and with return value
4.  without arguments and with return value

	Arguments are the values passing to the function at the time of calling. A fun can take any no of arugments.
	Return value is a value which return final result to the calling function.
