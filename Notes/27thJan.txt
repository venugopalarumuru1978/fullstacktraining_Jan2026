React Hooks
Hooks are the functions which "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from functional components.
Hooks are the new feature introduced in the React 16.8 version. It allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. It does not work inside classes(Hooks won't work in class components).

Note:-  Hooks should not use inside any other function. 

useState() :-  it is used to manage state of the variable / object. 
useNavigate() :- by using this hook, we can forward to any othe componenet.

useEffect() :-  it is used to call the restapi and assigns result to any component or state.
		it will get executed whenever component is loading/executing. 

useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect code
  return () => {
    // Cleanup function (optional)
  };
}, [dependencies]);

useRef() :-  to set value to any tool in forms(textbox, radiobutton, ...)
useParam() :-  to get value from url parameters.
